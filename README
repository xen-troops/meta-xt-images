XT-images
=========

This is set of images used by Xen-troops team to build
various configurations used for Xen [1] development and
delivery.

XT-quircks
==========

XT-quircks is a bitbake meta layer which simplifies automated
build and deployment of images. There are number of variables
recipes can use.

XT_QUIRCK_UNPACK_SRC_URI - list of URIs which are aditionally
fetched/unpacked after base do_unpack happens.

This is used to deliver additional files into the inner
(domain's) build to tune the build. For example, to deliver
Xen-troops additional meta layer on top of provided BSP and
Xen-troops images [2] and customize those for a particular
platform, one can use something like:
APPEND_XT_QUIRCK_UNPACK_SRC_URI := "file://${THISDIR}/files/meta-xt-extra;subdir=repo"
XT_QUIRCK_UNPACK_SRC_URI += "${APPEND_XT_QUIRCK_UNPACK_SRC_URI}"

This can also be used to deliver additional configuration and
other files into the inner build.

XT_QUIRCK_PATCH_SRC_URI - list of patches do be applied after
base do_unpack happens.

This quirck is used for builds where a BSP provides additional
patches as part of a fetched meta layer, e.g. via doc folder.
In order to be able to patch base do_patch cannot be used as
it relies on SRC_URI (all the patches have to be fetched first),
but at the time of base do_fetch the patch does not exist yet.
In order to allow that weird kind of patching this quirck
runs after base do_fetch/do_unpack actuall deliver the patch
onto the filesystem.
